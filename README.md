# GWBeat_Waveform

This repository is based on [cnn_matchfiltering](https://github.com/hagabbar/cnn_matchfiltering/) and [GWData-Bootcamp](https://github.com/iphysresearch/GWData-Bootcamp)

See [Note_for_GWBeat.pdf](Note_for_GWBeat.pdf) for introduction of the GW beats emited by superradiant scalar condensate. Note that the variation of frequency over time is not taken into account, i.e. $\dot{f}=0$. 

See [Waveform.ipynb](Waveform.ipynb) for generating the waveform.
